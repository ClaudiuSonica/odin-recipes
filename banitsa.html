                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Banitsa is a traditional Bulgarian cheese pie made with cheese, yogurt and eggs. It's perfect for breakfast or as a snack and it's best enjoyed warm! This simple pastry pie has a few other variations depending on ingredients used: cabbage, spinach or pumpkin are other favorites.</p>
                <h3>Tips</h3>
                <p>Each filo pastry sheet needs only a little bit of the feta filling. Adding way too much of it will result in a very salty banica. Now that being said, you can double the filling and add more, if you like.You don't have to cover the whole area of the filo sheet with the mixture.When rolling the Filo sheets are very fragile so avoid using pressure when rolling them into a sausage.Cooking time may vary. There are many things that affect this from the size of your oven to its quality, the size of your pie as well as the oven-proof dish/pan you use (they all conduct heat differently). For that reason, if you are making banitsa for the first time, cook it on a lower rack and increase cooking time if not golden brown and puffed on top.
                Use unsalted butter!</p>

                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <p>Preheat oven to 350° Fahrenheit (175° Celsius).</p>
                    <li>Meanwhile, take a round oven-proof dish and grease it with oil or butter and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Put drained feta in a mixing bowl and crumble it with a fork (or your fingers). Add yogurt, eggs and baking soda and mix everything well. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Spread one sheet of phyllo (filo) pastry on a clean work top, the wider side facing you. Brush some melted butter over the sheet.</li>
                    <li>Spoon some of the Feta mixture over and spread around a little. Lift the edge closest to you and roll/fold into a “sausage”.</li>
                    <li>Now, roll this into a snail (like you would when making cinnamon rolls). Place the “snail” in the middle of your oven dish/cake pan.</li>
                    <li>Repeat step 4 with another phyllo sheet. When ready, place it in the cake pan, just around the first “snail” and repeat with the rest of the sheets until you fill up you cake pan.</li>
                    <li>When done, pour the leftover melted butter over banitsa. Transfer the pan in the oven and bake at 350° Fahrenheit (175° Celsius) for 25 minutes or until puffed and golden brown on top.</li>
                    <li>When ready, take it out and let it cool slightly before slicing.</li>
                    <li>Enjoy!</li>
